# AoC 2022 in let-go

This repo contains my solutions to the [AoC 2022](https://adventofcode.com/) problems in [let-go](https://github.com/nooga/let-go), a small language I'm making. 

## Running 

Requires Go 1.19, to install `let-go`:

```
$ go install github.com/nooga/let-go@latest
```

Then, for example, to run Day 1:

```
$ let-go day1.lg
```
